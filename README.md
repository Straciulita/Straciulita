  👋 Hi, I’m @Straciulita
  
  👀 I’m interested in game development, web development, and exploring new technologies.
  
  🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, and web development, while improving my skills in game creation using Unity and other languages.
  
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects involving game development, web design, or anything that presents a new challenge!
  
  📫 How to reach me: @p_adelyna_m on ig 
  
  😄 Pronouns: she/her
  
  ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve created a maze game in Java where the maze generates differently each time you play. In my free time, I love reading and I'm always up for learning something new!
